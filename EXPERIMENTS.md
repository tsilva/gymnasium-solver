- 2025/08/06 - 9b63b11 - Pong-v5_deterministic_objects_ppo - solved, 21 eval with stochastic policy; deterministic policy took longer to catch up... at a certain point in training ep_mean_reward stagnated, first I increased learning rate and ep_mean_reward dropped, but then I increased entropy_coef and after entropy increased the policy improved and reached 21.0. Observation of the game showed the policy also exploiting the same loophole repeatedly (hit the ball with the paddle corner to propel it faster and at an angle). Need to try to get same results on stochastic environment.
