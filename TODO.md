- Add subprocenv suppport for video recording

MaxAndSkipEnv
- Should I normalize returns for REINFORCE?
- BUG: video step is still not alligned
- BUG: step 100 = reward 99
- Adjust eval policy for atari
	•	Normalize each byte (e.g., to [0,1]) and consider embedding bits (treat bytes as 8 bits).
	•	Try longer training and more seeds; RAM setups often need more steps to stabilize.
	•	If you can, expose extra emulator registers (RAM+) to reduce partial observability.
- How to measure advantage of different seeds versus reusing same env.
- Try creating local run folder with assets, create own run id and assign it to wandb if possible
- Consider increasing sample efficiency by figuring out how different are transitions between different envs
- FEAT: add determinism check at beginning to make sure that rollout benefits from multiple envs (eg: Pong, test on PongDeterministic)
- FEAT: create cartpole reward shaper that prioritizes centering the pole
- FEAT: track output distribution
- BUG: confirm that buffer growth is under control
- BUG: fix thread safety issues with async eval collector (copy model weights with lock)
- FEAT: consider computing mean reward by timesteps, this way in eval we just have to request n_steps = reward_threshold * N, this will make it easier to support vectorized envs
- FEAT: support for softcoding activations
- FEAT: a2c (only after reinforce/ppo is stable)
- FEAT: add same linear decay features as rlzoo
- FEAT: add interactive mode support
- CHECK: run rollout through dataloader process, do we always get n_batches? assert it 
- add support for plotting charts as text and feeding to llm, check how end of training does it

- FEAT: log results to huggingface
- FEAT: Write wandb diagnostics script, use claude desktop to debug
- FEAT: support continuous environments
- FEAT: support for multi-env rollout collectors

- Ask agent for next learning steps/tasks (prompt file)
- REFACTOR: add type hints where applicable
