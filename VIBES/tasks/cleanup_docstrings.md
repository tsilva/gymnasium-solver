# Clean up docstrings

## Goal
Make docstrings concise and purposeful across the repo: keep them only where intent is not obvious, reduce them to a short one‑line summary, and remove parameter/returns/raises sections.

## Steps
1. Align on style: read `VIBES/CODING_PRINCIPLES.md` (Python style) and this task. Target: short docstrings for non‑trivial helpers; explain "why" or high‑level behavior, not low‑level "what" or parameter details.
2. Discover candidates:
   - List docstring starts: `rg -n "^(\s*)(\"\"\"|''')" agents utils gym_wrappers trainer_callbacks scripts | cat` (also scan `train.py`, `run_*.py`).
   - Spot verbose sections: `rg -n "^(\s*)(Args:|Parameters:|Returns:|Raises:|Examples:)" | cat`.
3. Prune trivial cases: for self‑explanatory functions/classes (clear name, tiny body, simple forwarders/getters), remove the docstring entirely. Prefer no docstring over restating the name.
4. Rewrite the rest to a one‑liner:
   - Keep a single summary line ending with a period.
   - Focus on purpose/why or notable side‑effects/contract. Avoid listing params/returns/raises.
   - Remove sectioned blocks (`Args/Parameters/Returns/Raises/Examples`).
   - Prefer imperative mood ("Compute…", "Convert…"). Keep it as short as possible while remaining clear.
5. Add only where needed: if a non‑obvious function lacks a docstring, add a one‑line summary that explains intent or caveats (no param details).
6. Validate and summarize:
   - Run a quick grep to ensure sectioned blocks are gone: `rg -n "^(\s*)(Args:|Parameters:|Returns:|Raises:|Examples:)" | cat`.
   - Optionally run `pytest -q` to sanity‑check for any docstring‑related parsing/tests.
   - Record a brief summary in `TODO.md` of hotspots touched and any follow‑ups (if large files remain verbose).

## Notes
- Minimal diffs: do not reflow unrelated code; limit edits to docstrings you touch.
- Keep module/class docstrings only when they convey non‑obvious intent or constraints; keep them short.
- Prefer removing redundant docstrings over keeping restatements of the function name/signature.
- If a docstring documents a public API contract in prose, keep a short summary that states the contract, not the parameters.
- Do not introduce new tools/deps; rely on `rg`/`pytest` already in the repo. If you use other linters locally, don’t commit tool configs here.
