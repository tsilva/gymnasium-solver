ðŸ“Œ n_envs (number of parallel environments)
- âœ… Increases rollout size.
- âœ… More diverse data â†’ less correlated samples â†’ cleaner gradient estimates.
- âœ… Faster data collection via parallelization.
- â›” Higher memory usage.
- â›” Improves only spatial diversity (different states at same timestep), not temporal credit assignment.

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ n_steps (steps per environment before update)
- âœ… Increases rollout size.
- âœ… Better temporal credit assignment (exposes policy to longer returns).
- âœ… Reduces bootstrap bias in actorâ€“critic methods.
- â›” Consecutive samples are correlated (less diverse).
- â›” Slows updates (must wait for all steps before training).
- â›” Risk of GPU idle time if rollout collection is CPU-bound.

ðŸ“Œ Rules of thumb
- To ensure reproducibility, perform two runs in a row and ensure all wandb graphs are identical.
- âœ… Max out n_envs as far as CPU allows â€” cheap way to scale diversity and speed.
- âœ… Set n_steps long enough to capture temporal structure, but short enough to avoid stalling updates.
- âœ… For REINFORCE, aim for larger effective rollout sizes (n_envs Ã— n_steps) to tame high-variance returns.
- âœ… Use reward-to-go and baselines to cut variance further instead of only relying on bigger rollouts.
