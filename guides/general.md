📌 n_envs (number of parallel environments)
- ✅ Increases rollout size.
- ✅ More diverse data → less correlated samples → cleaner gradient estimates.
- ✅ Faster data collection via parallelization.
- ⛔ Higher memory usage.
- ⛔ Improves only spatial diversity (different states at same timestep), not temporal credit assignment.

⸻

📌 n_steps (steps per environment before update)
- ✅ Increases rollout size.
- ✅ Better temporal credit assignment (exposes policy to longer returns).
- ✅ Reduces bootstrap bias in actor–critic methods.
- ⛔ Consecutive samples are correlated (less diverse).
- ⛔ Slows updates (must wait for all steps before training).
- ⛔ Risk of GPU idle time if rollout collection is CPU-bound.

⸻

📌 Rules of thumb
- To ensure reproducibility, perform two runs in a row and ensure all wandb graphs are identical.
- Don't bother with running evals until you reach treshold on training.
- ✅ Max out n_envs as far as CPU allows — cheap way to scale diversity and speed.
- ✅ Set n_steps long enough to capture temporal structure, but short enough to avoid stalling updates.
- ✅ For REINFORCE, aim for larger effective rollout sizes (n_envs × n_steps) to tame high-variance returns.
- ✅ Use reward-to-go and baselines to cut variance further instead of only relying on bigger rollouts.

Great question — batch size is the third lever alongside n_envs and n_steps, since it controls how much of your collected data is actually used in one gradient update.

Here are the rules of thumb for batch sizes in policy gradient / actor–critic settings:

⸻

📌 Batch Size (data used per gradient update)
	•	✅ Larger batch sizes
	•	Lower gradient variance → more stable learning.
	•	More efficient use of GPU (parallel matrix ops).
	•	Especially useful for on-policy methods (PPO, REINFORCE) where sample efficiency is limited.
	•	⛔ Too large batch sizes
	•	Slower iteration speed (fewer updates per unit of data).
	•	Risk of underfitting if learning rate is not scaled accordingly.
	•	Memory bottlenecks.
	•	✅ Smaller batch sizes
	•	More frequent updates → faster reaction to data.
	•	Potentially better exploration through noisier gradients.
	•	⛔ Too small batch sizes
	•	Extremely noisy gradients → unstable training.
	•	Wastes parallel compute since GPUs run less efficiently on tiny batches.

⸻

📌 Rules of thumb
	•	Batch size ≈ 32–256 per update is a good starting range for most RL workloads (mirrors supervised learning practice).
	•	In PPO / A2C, set batch_size as a fraction of n_envs × n_steps (commonly minibatches = 4–32 splits).
	•	A good heuristic:
	•	Keep batch_size ≥ action_dim × 10 to avoid overly noisy gradients.
	•	Ensure each batch contains samples from multiple environments (so you’re not overfitting to one trajectory slice).
	•	For REINFORCE / high-variance returns, bigger batches (≥1k samples) are often necessary for stable updates.
	•	For continuous control (MuJoCo, PyBullet, etc.), ~2–10k samples per update (via multiple envs × steps, split into minibatches) tends to be standard.

⸻

⚖️ Balance tip:
	•	Effective rollout size = n_envs × n_steps.
	•	From this pool, choose batch_size so that you have at least 4–10 minibatches per epoch.
	•	Example: if rollout size = 8192, set batch_size = 256 → 32 minibatches per epoch.

👉 Do you want me to make a summary diagram showing how n_envs, n_steps, and batch_size interact (like a flow of rollout → minibatching → updates)? That could complement your guide nicely.
